![qlm](qlm.jpg?raw=true "qlm")

Package qlm implements a simple, high-level wrapper for ql, a native, embedded
database engine written in Go. Each table in the database is associated with an
application-defined structure in Go. These structures contain special tags that
allow qlm to automatically manage all database operations.
See the [documentation][1] for more details.
